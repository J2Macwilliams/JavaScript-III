/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global Binding -When in the Global Scope, the value of *this* will be the window/console object.  

* 2. Implicit Binding - *this* is pointing to the object it is placed in.  Pointing to the left of the dot when the function is invoked.  

* 3. New Binding - In JS, when a constructor function is used, the *new* keyword creates a new object, *this* refers to that object. 


* 4. Explicit Binding - When the JSâ€™s call or apply method is used, *this* is explicitly defined. *this* tells the JS engine to point to a certain value.



*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
